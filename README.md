# sadgeETW
A custom implementation of Casey Muratori's [Event Tracing for Windows Halloween Spooktacular Challenge](https://www.computerenhance.com/p/announcing-the-etw-halloween-spooktacular).

This is essentially a port of Casey's [pmctrace](https://github.com/cmuratori/pmctrace) reference code in Jai, although some minor implementation details differ, since I was following along with the challenge from the beginning and implementing everything on my own before the ref code was actually available.
